"""The library's two standing credential claims, executed rather than asserted in prose.

Story 1.7 does not repair the way credentials are handled -- they already travel
as an ``auth=`` kwarg, out of every URL, and settings payloads are already never
logged. What it does is make those claims *run*: a full session drives every
public request path, healthy and failing, with the whole ``aiosecurityspy``
logger tree captured at level 0, and every URL the library builds or sends is
checked for userinfo and credential-shaped parameters.

Self-contained by house rule: there is no ``conftest.py``, so the stub server
lives here. It serves the real recorded shapes for every endpoint at once,
because a sweep that only exercised one of them would not be a sweep.
