"""Questions only a real SecuritySpy server can answer.

Every test here is marked ``live`` and skips unless ``aiosecurityspy/.env``
supplies a server, so the offline suite -- and CI, and any clone -- is
unaffected. See ``.env.example`` for the variables.

These exist because a family of decoding and refusal questions cannot be
settled offline without guessing at the answer, and a fixture authored to match
a guess is precisely how Epic 1 acquired nine bugfix stories. The deferred-work
ledger records each of them as "needs a live server":

* **DW 1.6a** -- both settings and arming writes discard the response body and
  treat any 2xx as success. A server that answers 200 with an error page, or
  silently ignores a write from an unprivileged account, is today
  indistinguishable from one that applied it. On a security product "the camera
  is disarmed" returning cleanly when nothing changed is the expensive failure.
* **T10** -- ``ARM_OVERRIDE_UNCHANGED`` (-1) is annotated in research §5.2 as a
  *client* sentinel, yet it is the default for ``async_set_camera_arming`` and is
  transmitted on every arming call that does not name an override.
* **Per-camera permissions** -- the library models the mask per camera rather
  than per account. Nothing has confirmed it varies within one account.
* **Bit 1 (value 2)** -- set on live cameras and named nowhere
  (``securityspy-6.21-verification.md`` §4.1).

Credentials are never asserted on, logged, or written to a fixture; a failure
here must be diagnosable from status codes and shapes alone.
